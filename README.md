ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m SearidangPa. I am a 2nd year PhD student in CS at Northeastern University. My past research experience lies broadly in the theoretical design and analysis of robust and dynamic network and quantum algorithms. ðŸŒ± Lately, I have developed an interest in the decision side of Machine Learning. More specifically, the dream goal would be to design a robust and transparent system that take into account the game theoretic dance between humans and Machine Learning, for the well-being of each individual human in this dynamically connected world. 

In the real implementation side, I also love implementing machine learning to challenging problems and working on projects that seek to understanding various robust low-level system design and optimization. My dream is to to work in an open-minded and inspiring group that tackles challenging, beautiful, and impactful problems that would add positive values to the world in the present and in the future.
