I am a 2nd year PhD student in CS at Northeastern University. My research interest lies broadly in the design and analysis of robust and dynamic network algorithms.
🌱 Lately I am trying to get into peer-to-peer learning in a federated setting. 


I also love implementing machine learning to challenging problems and working on projects that seek to understanding the low-level system optimization. 
My dream is to To work in an open-minded and inspiring group to tackle challenging, beautiful, 
and impactful problems that would add positive values to the world in the present and in the future.
