Hi, Iâ€™m Searidang Pa. I am a 2nd year PhD student in CS at Northeastern University. My dream is to to work in an open-minded and inspiring group that tackles challenging and meaningful problems. 

On the coding side, I like implementing machine learning to tackle challenging problems, and projects that seek to understanding low-level robust system design and optimization. I love elegant coding practices, and I'm always happy to continually learn about small and big ideas. 

My past research experience lies broadly in the theoretical design and analysis of robust and dynamic network algorithms and quantum algorithms. ðŸŒ± Lately, I have developed an interest in the decision side of Machine Learning. More specifically, the dream goal would be a robust and transparent system that takes into account the game theoretic dance between humans and ML.
