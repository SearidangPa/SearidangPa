I'm currently interning at Preveil for Summer 2022. I am looking for a full-time Software Engineer position after fall 2022. I like implementing robust system design and optimization. I love learning about elegant coding practices and how to be a better collaborator. My dream is to to work in an open-minded and inspiring group that tackles challenging and meaningful problems.
