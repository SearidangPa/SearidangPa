ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m SearidangPa. I am a 2nd year PhD student in CS at Northeastern University. My research interest lies broadly in the design and analysis of robust and dynamic network algorithms. ðŸŒ± Lately I am trying to get into peer-to-peer learning in a federated setting. 


I also love implementing machine learning to challenging problems and working on projects that seek to understanding the low-level system optimization. 
My dream is to to work in an open-minded and inspiring group that tackles challenging, beautiful, and impactful problems that would add positive values to the world in the present and in the future. You can reach me at pa.s@northeastern.edu.
